ðŸ“š LATEST RESEARCH PAPERS (3)
----------------------------------------

1. SimuRA: Towards General Goal-Oriented Agent via Simulative Reasoning Architecture with LLM-Based World Model
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: SimuRA overcomes the limitations of autoregressive reasoning by introducing a world model for planning via simulation. The generalized world model is implemented using LLM, which can flexibly plan in a wide range of environments using the concept-rich latent space of natural language.
   Key Findings: Introduces SimuRA, a goal-oriented architecture for generalized agentic reasoning using LLMs and world model simulation for planning.

2. Distributed AI Agents for Cognitive Underwater Robot Autonomy
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: UROSA decentralises cognition into specialised AI agents responsible for multimodal perception, adaptive reasoning, dynamic mission planning, and real-time decision-making. Includes flexible agents dynamically adapting their roles, retrieval-augmented generation, reinforcement learning-driven behavioural optimisation, and autonomous on-the-fly ROS 2 node generation for runtime functional extensibility.
   Key Findings: Presents UROSA, an architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents within ROS 2 to enable advanced cognitive capabilities in Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.

3. A survey of multi-agent geosimulation methodologies: from ABM to LLM
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: This paper confirms a framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms. Our findings show that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
   Key Findings: Examines agent-based approaches for multi-agent systems, simulations, and information systems, confirming a framework for geosimulation platforms. Shows that LLMs can be effectively incorporated as agent components.
