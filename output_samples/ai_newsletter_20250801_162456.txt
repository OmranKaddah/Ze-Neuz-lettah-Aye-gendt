----------------------------------------

1. Phi-Ground Tech Report: Advancing Perception in GUI Grounding
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: This paper conducts an empirical study on the training of grounding models for Computer Use Agents (CUAs), and develops the Phi-Ground model family.
   Key Findings: Phi-Ground model family achieves state-of-the-art performance across all five grounding benchmarks for models under $10B parameters in agent settings.

2. Distributed AI Agents for Cognitive Underwater Robot Autonomy
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: This paper presents Underwater Robot Self-Organizing Autonomy (UROSA), a architecture leveraging distributed Large Language Model AI agents within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework.
   Key Findings: UROSA demonstrates promising adaptability and reliability through realistic underwater missions, showing significant advantages over traditional rule-based architectures.

3. A survey of multi-agent geosimulation methodologies: from ABM to LLM
   Date: July 31, 2025
   Summary: This paper provides a comprehensive examination of agent-based approaches that codify the principles and linkages underlying multi-agent systems, simulations, and information systems. It confirms a framework intended as a formal specification for geosimulation platforms.
   Key Findings: LLMs can be effectively incorporated as agent components if they follow a structured architecture specific to fundamental agent activities such as perception, memory, planning, and action.
